<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project was created as a rails application configured to react using the --webpack=react key  
GitHub was initialized and Linters and rubocop were installed before coding  

The user logs in the application, by typing the username and password, and is presented with a list of services  
An image slider shows the doctors of the medical center  

Booking for a type of service is performed in the Booking view by entering Date, Department, Doctors board and Description  
Booking entries can be edited or deleted  
All bookings of a user are shown in the Bookings List

Design guidelines are based on this [link](https://www.behance.net/gallery/26425031/Vespa-Responsive-Redesign)  
 

- The application responds well to small screens of tablets and mobiles  
- The database has been implemented with Postgres. There is a users table, a table holding the departments and a table holding the bookings  
- For the back-end Ruby on Rails is used. Implements a REST API to manage database resources
- The front-end is using React
    - Connects to the back-end API to send and receive domain data
    - With routes for each of the screens, so the user can easily go back and forward  
    - Using redux to store info used across the app  
- The project has been deployed and accessible online on [heroku]("https://medical-services-jgk.herokuapp.com")

- Transitions have been implement in the Doctors View
