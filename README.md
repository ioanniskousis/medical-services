<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project was created as a rails application configured to react using the --webpack=react key  

It is a Single Page Application using Redux Routers to show subpages   
The entry point leads to the Symbols List where available symbols are shown including company name, the last closing price and the Stock Exchange where the symbol is traded  
Symbols can be filtered by their container Stock Exchange using the filter selection at the top-right  
Clicking a symbol panel shows the Symbol Profile page where all available information about the selected symbol is shown in a table view  

The project files tree:

```
  
```

  - The entry point is root **scr/index.js** where the **App** component is rendered through the **Provider** components of Redux. 
  - Actions **initInstruments**, **changeFilter**, **showProfile**, and **showList** are in **actions/actionsIndex.js**  
  - Componet **App** is held in respective file in **components/** folder  
  - Reducers are in **reducers/** folder, currently only 1, the **instrumentsReducer** in reducers/instrumentsReducer.js is combined into **reducersIndex** held in reducers/reducersIndex.js  
  - The **App** component renders either 
    - **InstrumentsListHeader** and **InstrumentsList**  
    or  
    - **InstrumentProfileHeader** and **InstrumentProfile**  
    components depending on selection between the index of symbols or a symbols's profile
  - The **InstrumentsListHeader** component renders the header for the **Symbols List**, and filters symbols on selected Stock Exchage  
  - The **InstrumentsList** renders the **Symbols List**  
  - The **InstrumentProfileHeader** component renders the header for the **InstrumentProfile**  
  - The **InstrumentProfile** renders all available information about an instrument  

#### Please note that the number of downloaded symbols by the API is 14000+, so I limited this by slicing the array on the first 200 symbols
